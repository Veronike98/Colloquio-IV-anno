# Penrose's Singularity Theorem
![Build LaTeX documents](https://github.com/arn4/colloquio/workflows/LaTeX%20documents/badge.svg)

This is the repository of my 4th-year seminar (a.k.a. *colloquio*) at Scuola Normale Superiore.

The purpose of this talk is to present a proof of Penrose's singularity theorem and some of its general consequences by the introduction of a few basic concepts.

The previous knowledge required is only an introduction to General Relativity and some notions of Riemannian Geometry.
